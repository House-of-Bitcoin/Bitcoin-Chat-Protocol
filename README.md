## **Abstract**
Bitcoin Chat Protocol is an open-source, decentralized messaging protocol built on the Bitcoin network. It leverages Bitcoin addresses as universal user identities, enabling both public SuperChats and private P2P messaging. This protocol provides a censorship-resistant, trust-based communication system where Bitcoin itself acts as the backbone for both identity and payments. 

## **1. Introduction**
With increasing censorship on centralized platforms, there is a need for a free and decentralized messaging system. Bitcoin Chat Protocol introduces a new paradigm by utilizing Bitcoin addresses for identity and messaging, removing reliance on traditional account-based platforms. This protocol enables two key applications:

1. **Bitcoin SuperChat** - A showcase platform that allows users to send messages, highlight them via Bitcoin payments, and interact in live-streamed events, similar to YouTube SuperChat.
2. **Bitcoin P2P Messaging** - A private, end-to-end encrypted messaging system where users communicate directly using their Bitcoin addresses.

This protocol serves as the foundation for both applications and is open for anyone to build upon.

## **2. Core Features**
### **2.1 Identity & Authentication**
- Users authenticate via Bitcoin address ownership.
- Messages can be signed with a private key to verify identity.
- No need for centralized accounts‚Äîpurely cryptographic authentication.
- One address for everything‚Äîchat, payments, SuperChats, and more.

### **2.2 Messaging System**
- Messages are transmitted over **WebSockets** for real-time communication.
- Messages can include optional **Bitcoin payments** for prioritization.
- SuperChats allow users to **pay to boost** their messages in public chat.
- P2P messages remain **private & encrypted** between two users.

### **2.3 Trust & Anti-Spam Mechanism**
- Users with **0 balance** are marked as ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù (to prevent spam).
- ‚ÄúWholecoiners‚Äù (users with 1+ BTC) receive **priority status**.
- Optional **Proof-of-Work (PoW) challenge** to limit spam (similar to Hashcash).

### **2.4 Payment Integration**
- Supports both **Lightning Network** (instant transactions) and **on-chain** Bitcoin payments.
- Users can attach BTC payments to messages to **increase visibility**.
- **P2P payments** allow users to send BTC directly to each other via chat.

## **3. Protocol Design**
### **3.1 Messaging Flow**
1. User enters a Bitcoin address (or generates one on the spot).
2. User signs a message to prove ownership of the address.
3. Messages are sent via WebSockets and broadcast to all users (SuperChat) or privately (P2P Messaging).
4. If a payment is attached, the transaction is validated before boosting the message.

### **3.2 On-Chain vs. Lightning Toggle**
- Users can choose to send payments **on-chain** (higher fees, better permanence) or via **Lightning** (low fees, instant settlement).
- The protocol ensures both methods interoperate seamlessly.

## **4. Real-World Applications**
### **4.1 House of Bitcoin (houseofbitcoin.org)**
- An open-source platform built on **Next.js + Sanity.io**
- Tracks Bitcoin adoption, company investments, and global Bitcoin policies.
- A free knowledge base for the Bitcoin community.

### **4.2 Bitcoin SuperChat (bitcoinsuperchat.org)**
- A **showcase** platform demonstrating how Bitcoin Chat Protocol works.
- Users can send paid SuperChats during live streams, tip content creators, and engage in Bitcoin-native chatrooms.
- Can be expanded for integrations into decentralized media platforms.

## **5. Technical Implementation**
- **Frontend:** Next.js + React.js for a scalable UI.
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express and Socket.io for message routing.
- **Bitcoin Integration:** `bitcoinjs-lib` for address generation and `lnbits` API for Lightning transactions.

## **6. Open-Source Model & Licensing**
- Released under the **MIT License** to promote free usage and modifications.
- Open-source repositories will be maintained for public contribution.
- Community governance through GitHub proposals and decentralized voting.

## **7. Future Roadmap**
- üîπ **Decentralized storage** for message retention (IPFS or Nostr integration).
- üîπ **Mobile-friendly** Bitcoin SuperChat client.
- üîπ **Privacy-enhanced** P2P messaging with full encryption.
- üîπ **Trustless escrow payments** for marketplace integration.
- üîπ **Integration with decentralized social networks.**

## **8. Conclusion**
Bitcoin Chat Protocol is a new decentralized messaging framework that uses Bitcoin addresses as both identity and a financial layer. It introduces a censorship-resistant alternative to traditional messaging, leveraging Bitcoin payments to establish trust and reduce spam. This system has the potential to revolutionize both public and private communication in the digital age while staying true to Bitcoin‚Äôs open-source ethos.
